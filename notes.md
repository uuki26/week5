Sonifiction

It is surprised to see the data can be transformed into a song, and played by different instruments. 

I first selected “basque country daily time use data 2013” from twotone, 

and I found out the graph of the sound is keep increasing. 

Then, I tried another data called "sonifiction-roman-data" provided by the professor. 
The sound graph looks different than the previous one.

I checked the "sonifiction-roman-data", found out the column changed based on the original number. 

The data showed on the second column of "sonifiction-roman-data" are 80 128 128 128 1. 
So the sound column is going down and up with the trend of the number.
