Sonifiction

It is surprised to see the data can be transformed into a song, and played by different instruments. 

I first selected “basque country daily time use data 2013” from twotone, 

and I found out the graph of the sound is keep increasing. 

Then, I tried another data called "sonifiction-roman-data" provided by the professor. 
The sound graph looks different than the previous one.

I checked the "sonifiction-roman-data", found out the column changed based on the original number. 

The data showed on the second column of "sonifiction-roman-data" are 80 128 128 128 1. 
So the sound column is going down and up with the trend of the number. 
Here is the link of the music: https://github.com/uuki26/week5/blob/master/sonification-roman-data.mp3

StoryMaps

StoryMap is a very interesting website that can make a slide show with websites on a map. 

I decidede to do mine with the theme about importanat historic moment in Canada.

I started with "Norse Explorers meet Indigenos Peoples" and ended with "The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms".

While making this map, I also learned some new historic knowlagede about the Canadian history. 

Besides, I got a lovely story map.

I enjoy using this  websites, and it is such an useful tool for both history and geography.
