By using different digital tools, I realized that data and sound can be combined perfectly, 
and data are not only be shown in the way of numbers or form. 
Data can also be shown to people through music. 
Digital tools make using data more fun, and easy to understand the trend of a statistical from. 
Knowing the trend of data can also by listening rather than only looking at the graph. 

Storymap is much more complex than doing the sonification, but I have gained so much sense of achievement after I finished the 
story map. 

Creating a storymap provides me with a great experience of using digital tools to demonstrate the knowledge of history and geography.
It is also a helpful tool that I can use in the future.
